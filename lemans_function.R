# long-term spawning stock biomass for 9 species listed above, in order, 
# from 1986 to 2016 (nyears could be post data like for mizer, in which case
# it would be 1986 to 2050, which would make more sense)
# but it only gives 31 years, so it's either 1986 to 2016, or 2020 to 2050?

test_run_lemans$Yield
# and the same for yield, which is -Inf for all species and all years (?)

# F refers to the fishing mortality for each species, so is a vector of
# length n, where n is the number of species. F lies between 0 and 2
